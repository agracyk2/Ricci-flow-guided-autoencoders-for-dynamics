We present Ricci-flow guided autoencoders in learning time-dependent dynamics, an autoencoder method for learning PDE data with a manifold latent space subject to Ricci flow. The latent manifold faciliates qualities such as learning for out-of-distribution data and robustness. Simultaneously, the continuous nature of the geometric flow means a latent manifold is sustained for all values in the ambient PDE interval.
